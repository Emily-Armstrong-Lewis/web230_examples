        <p>This is something I wrote for my CPS701 Masters Course
It combines some drag and drop, reading from an XML file via Ajax (without a php backend I wrote a simplified ajax function just for this exercise), and using local web storage.</p>
    
    <p>On load it checks the local web storage for any senators, if not found then it loads them from the XML file into local web storage.  By dragging their names into the appropriate boxes it puts their name in the box and updates the local web storage.  If you drag a name into the wrong box it will not drop.</p>
    
    <p>I did what was asked for the assignment but a modification would have been to remove each name from the master list once in the box and/or make sure you could not enter a name twice in the same box (now you can but it does not write to local storage).  </p>
    
    <p>NOTE: I realize some of them are no longer in office.</p>

         <p>Drag members to either the Democrats or Republicans list.</p>
